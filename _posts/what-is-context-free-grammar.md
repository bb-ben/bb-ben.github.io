# What is Context-Free Grammar?



Here's an example of Context-Free Grammar:
$$
A\textrightarrow 0A \\
A\textrightarrow 1A \\
A\textrightarrow 0 \\
A\textrightarrow 1 \\
A\textrightarrow \epsilon
$$


This CFG describes the binary language. In the grammar, A is called a **variable**, while $\epsilon$, 0, and 1 are called **terminals**. Each row is called a rule of this CFG. Normally, the top most rule states the **start variable**; So, in this case the start variable is A.
